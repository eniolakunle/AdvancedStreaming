# ðŸ¦• Exercise 1: Dinosaur Health Monitoring System 

To keep the park running smoothly, we need to keep track of the health of all dinosaurs. We
need to identify any ill dinosaurs. Using a stream of Dinosaur objects, filter out dinosaurs
that are ill (assuming the isIll() method exists the in Dinosaur class), map them to their
names, and collect the results in a list. Lastly, print out this list of names of the dinosaurs that
need immediate attention.

## ðŸš¨ Task Overview

To maintain the park's operations and ensure the well-being of our dinosaurs, we need to identify any ill dinosaurs and handle them with care.

### Steps to Achieve This:

1. **Stream Processing**:
    - Given a stream of `Dinosaur` objects, we will filter out the ones that are ill.
    - We will use the `isIll()` method from the `Dinosaur` class for this.

2. **Mapping**:
    - Once we have the ill dinosaurs, weâ€™ll map them to their names using the `getName()` method.

3. **Collection**:
    - Gather the names of all the ill dinosaurs into a list.

4. **Output**:
    - Print the list of dinosaur names that need immediate medical attention.
