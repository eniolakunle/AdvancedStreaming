# ðŸ¦• Exercise 2: Dinosaur Park Management System

Managing a dinosaur park of this size involves handling large amounts of data. To make an
announcement in the park about dinosaur feeding times, create a list of dinosaurs, convert it into
a stream, and use the map() function to get a list of dinosaur names. Then, use the forEach
terminal operation to print out a message for each dinosaurâ€™s feeding time.
## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates how to efficiently announce feeding times for dinosaurs using Java streams. By converting a list of dinosaurs into a stream, we can easily extract their names and print announcements for each dinosaur's feeding time.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Efficient Data Management**: Handle large datasets of dinosaur information.
- **Stream Processing**: Use Java streams to process data seamlessly.
