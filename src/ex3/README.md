# ðŸ¦• Exercise 3: Dinosaur Food Estimator

Keeping track of the total food required for all the dinosaurs can be tricky. Suppose you have
an array of weights of all dinosaurs. Convert it into an IntStream and use the sum method
to get the total weight of all dinosaurs in the park. This could help you estimate the total
food requirements.

<br />

## ðŸš¨ Task Overview

Imagine you have an array of dinosaur weights, and you need to calculate the total weight of all these massive creatures to determine how much food is required. This project demonstrates how you can convert an array of dinosaur weights into a Java `IntStream` and use the `sum()` method to get the total weight in an efficient way.

<br />

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Input**: You provide an array of integers representing the weights of dinosaurs in kilograms.
2. **Stream API**: The array is converted into an `IntStream`, which is then summed up using the `sum()` method.
3. **Output**: The total weight of all dinosaurs is calculated, giving you a clear estimate of the food required.
