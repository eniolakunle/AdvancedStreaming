# 🏋️‍♂️ Exercise 5: Dinosaur Weight Calculator

Calculating the average weight of dinosaurs can be a time-consuming operation, especially
when dealing with a large number of dinosaurs. To speed up the process, use parallel streams.
Convert a list of dinosaur weights into a parallel stream and use the average method to calculate
the average weight.

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Java's parallel streams to speed up the calculation process, ensuring performance optimization while handling significant amounts of data.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Efficient Average Calculation**: Use parallel streams to quickly compute the average weight of dinosaurs.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets without sacrificing performance.
